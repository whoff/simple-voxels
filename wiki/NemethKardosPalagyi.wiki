#summary Nemeth, Kardos and Palagyi's thinning algorithm with smoothing
= Introduction =
In order to reduce spurious branches,
we can use the last two methods
[RaynalCouprie Raynal and Couprie] and
[LohouBertrand Lohou and Bertrand]
that remove more simple points at each subiteration
that are not deleted by [PalagyiKuba Palagyi and Kuba]'s method.
Because the spurious branches are originating from spurious end
points that are not deletable, removing more simple voxels leads
to the reduction of spurious branches.

The above consideration suggests that it would also be effective
to suppress the generation of spurious end points to reduce spurious branches.
In fact, although the 3x3x3 template matching is a very efficient technique, it is based on local information only.
As a result, objects are not always thinned uniformly
through iterations, and their surface will have noisy voxels.

In [Top#References [4]],
Nemeth, Kardos, and Palagyi proposed
additional 2 subiterations for the surface noise reduction.
They are used as a preprocessing before each major iteration.


obtained skeletons may deviate from the true center lines of objects.
especially after many iterations for big or thick objects.
