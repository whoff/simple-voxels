#summary Nemeth, Kardos and Palagyi's thinning algorithm with smoothing
= Introduction =
In order to reduce spurious branches,
we can use the last two methods
[RaynalCouprie Raynal and Couprie] and
[LohouBertrand Lohou and Bertrand]
that remove more simple points at each subiteration
that are not deleted by [PalagyiKuba Palagyi and Kuba]'s method.
Because the spurious branches are originating from spurious end
points that are not deletable, removing more simple voxels leads
to the reduction of spurious branches.

Another way of reducing the spurious branches is to suppress the generation of spurious end points.

Although 3x3x3 template matching is a very efficient technique,
because it is based on the local information,
objects may not be thinned uniformly resulting in some noisy voxels
on its surface after iterations.

In [Top#References [4]], Nemeth, Kardos, and Palagyi proposed
additional 2 subiterations for the surface noise reduction.
They are used as a preprocessing before each major iteration.


obtained skeletons may deviate from the true center lines of objects.
especially after many iterations for big or thick objects.
