#summary Nemeth, Kardos and Palagyi's thinning algorithm with smoothing
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =
The spurious branches that are often observed with topological thinning algorithms are ending with "spurious" end points.
The removal of more end points thus leads to the reduction of the spurious branches.
In fact, with the deletable conditions proposed by
[RaynalCouprie Raynal and Couprie] and
[LohouBertrand Lohou and Bertrand],
the spurious branches are considerably reduced as these methods
remove more simple points at each subiteration than
[PalagyiKuba Palagyi and Kuba]'s method does.

Another way of reducing the spurious branches is
to suppress the generation of the spurious end points.
The 3x3x3 template matching is a very efficient technique,
however, as it is based on local information only,
objects are not always thinned uniformly through iterations
leaving noisy voxels on the object surface.

In [Top#References [4]],
Nemeth, Kardos, and Palagyi proposed additional 2 subiterations
to remove the noisy voxels and smooth the object surface,
which are used as a preprocessing before each major iteration.

The noisy voxel reduction can also improve the obtained skeletons.
Especially for large or thick objects that needs more thinning iterations,
the skeletons may deviate more from their medial lines because
the object surface is fluctuated at every iteration due to the noisy voxels.
