== Voxel Neighbors ==
In the implementation of this project, the 3x3x3 neighborhood situation of a voxel is represented by a 32-bit integer whose lower 27 bits show whether the corresponding position is foreground (black) or background (white) by the bit '1' or '0', respectively.

The neighboring points are assigned to the lower 27 bits as follows:
