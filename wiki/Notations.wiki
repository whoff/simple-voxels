== Voxel Neighbors ==
In the implementation of this project, the 3x3x3 neighborhood situation of a voxel is represented by a 32-bit integer whose lower 27 bits show whether the corresponding position is foreground (black) or background (white) by the bit '1' or '0', respectively.

The assignment of the neighboring points to the bit positions is as follows:

== Helper Macro ==
There are defined macro functions to make an integer from the bit patterns:

{{{
    const int bits = BV( BP(0,0,0), BP(0,2,0), BP(0,0,0) );
}}}

BV and BP means "bit volume" and "bit plane", respectively.
The numbers in BP represents the consecutive 3 bits on each line.
Therefore, in the above example, bits represents a situation
where the center voxel is the only voxel that is in the foreground (black, 1) while all its 26 neighbors are background (white, 0) ones.
