#summary definition of simple voxels

== Simple Voxels ==
Consider a 3D shape composed of (26-connected) foreground voxels.
When the removal of a voxel does not change the topology of the 3D shape, the voxel is called "simple". For example,
  * if a voxel is on a 1-voxel-wide line, it is not simple because its removal divides the line into two shorter lines.
  * similarly, if a voxel is on a 1-voxel-thick surface, it is not simple either because its remove makes a hole in the surface.
