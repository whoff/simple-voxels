#summary definition of simple voxels
= Simple Voxels =
== Example ==
Consider a 3D shape composed of foreground voxels.
When the removal of a foreground voxel does not change the topology of the 3D shape, the voxel is called simple. For example,
  * Sphere of radius 100 voxels: its surface voxels are all simple because their removal makes only a tiny dent on the surface and is never earth-shattering as to change the topology.
  * Line of 1-voxel width: its two end voxels are simple, but the internal voxels are not because their removal divides the line into two shorter lines.
  * Square plane of 1-voxel thickness: its border voxels are simple, but the internal voxels are not because their removal makes a hole in the plane.

== Definition ==
The simplicity of a voxel can be defined locally within its 3x3x3 neighborhood [1-3].
For the (26, 6) connectivity, a voxel is simple if the following two conditions are satisfied: ignoring the center voxel to be tested,
  * the number of 26-connected foreground (or black) components in its 26-neighborhood is 1.
  * the number of 6-connected background (or white) components in its 18-neighborhood that appear in the 6-neighborhood is 1.
