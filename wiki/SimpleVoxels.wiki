#summary definition of simple voxels

== Simple Voxels ==
Consider a 3D shape composed of foreground voxels.
When the removal of a voxel does not change the topology of the 3D shape, the voxel is called "simple". For example,
  * Sphere of radius 100 voxels: its surface voxels are all simple because their removal makes only a tiny dent on the surface and is never earth-shattering as to change the topology.
  * Line of 1-voxel width: its two end voxels are simple, but the internal voxels are not because their removal divides the line into two shorter lines.
  * Square plane of 1-voxel thickness: its border voxels are simple, but the internal voxles are not because their remove makes a hole in the plane.
