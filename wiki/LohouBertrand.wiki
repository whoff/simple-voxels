= Introduction =
By using [RaynalCouprie Raynal and Couprie]'s method,
a considerable amount of spurious brances will be reduced.
In addition, as was suggested in [Top#References [2]],
if the isthmus points were not preserved but removed,
all the skeletal branches would also be removed resulting in _ultimate thinning_,
where no more points can be removed without breaking the topology.
An ultimately thinned object has no branches and is composed of circular curves or cocoon like shells.

However, as far as I tested, there still remained some branches even when the isthmus points were removed.
Some of the remaining branches end with a specific configuration depicted in the figure below.

It turned out that this configuration is one of those that are pointed out
to be non-deletable by [PalagyiKuba Palagyi and Kuba]'s method [Top#References [3]].

In [Top#References [3]], Lohou and Bertrand proposed another
deletable condition based on a powerful notion of _Px-simple_,
with which one can devise a new parallel thinning algorithm without checking
whether its matching templates are consistent to allow parallel removal of deletable points while preserving topology.

= Definition =
The deletable condition is given based on P2x-simplicity.

== P2-simple ==
The P2-simplicity is defined by a point x and its 4-neighborhodd with the points above them as in:

  * x is P2 simple.
  * P2x points in the 26-neighborhood of x is
